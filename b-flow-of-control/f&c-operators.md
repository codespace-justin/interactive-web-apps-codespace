# ----- Logical Operators -----

The following are operators that can be used in certain conditional expressions/statements/etc. similar to how Arithmetic operations are used when solving mathematical expressions/statements/etc.

- &&   AND   : both expressions must be true for functionality to run
- ||   OR          : either of the two conditions must be true for functionality to run
- !   NOT         : functionality will run if condition is false or opposite of criteria

# ----- Comparison Operators -----

The following operators are used when comparing to or more values or data (you have already seen/worked with a few of them before). Eg: variables against variables, variables against some criteria or literal value, etc.

- ==   equal to    : both have equal value
- ===  equal to    : both have equal data type and value
- !=   not equal   : not equal value
- !==  not equal   : not equal equal data type and value

- >  greater       : 1st value is greater than 2nd value
- <  lesser        : 1st value is lesser than 2nd value

- >=  greater or equal     : 1st value is greater than 2nd value
- <=  lesser or equal      : 1st value is lesser than 2nd value
